                    <p class="text-center sm:text-left font-serif text-2xl font-light leading-relaxed">Iâ€™m McNeill, an eCommerce consultant with 13 years of experience leading in-house strategy, operations, and design for creative product-based businesses in the fashion and interiors spaces.</p>
                    <p class="text-center sm:text-left font-serif text-2xl font-light leading-relaxed">My sweet spot lies in merging a deep understanding of brand aesthetic and voice with the structure, prioritization, and and analytical approach that every sustainable business needs (spreadsheets are my love language!). I especially love working with businesses on the smaller side, particularly those with a deeply personal mission or aesthetic.</p>
                    <p class="text-center sm:text-left font-serif text-2xl font-light leading-relaxed">Outside of my working life, my favorite hobbies are decorating, crafting, reading, gardening, traveling, and snuggling my pooch Ruthie. </p>
