You (founder extraordinaire) have imagery, and even some copy, but it's scattered across your phone, email, existing pages on your website, etc. You'd like to hire someone to execute the creation and posting, but don't have any kind of structure in place for that person to follow. I can design and implement a content storage system, set up a content calendar for you to maintain, as well as standards for your new employee to follow.</p>
